# Fabric Real-Time Analytics In-A-Day  

Fabric RTA-In-A-Day is a hands-on, learning session aimed to provide Fabric RTA knowledge to participants having minimal or no prior exposure to the product. The topics covered in these hands-on sessions are fundamental topics relating to Fabric RTA and Kusto Query Language (KQL). The Learning sessions are divided into 2 labs meant to be delivered in any of the 2 following styles.

- 2 days of 4 Hours each (Day 1 ‚Äì Lab 1 and Day 2 ‚Äì Lab 2) - Recommended (OR)
- 1 day of 8 Hours (Day 1 ‚Äì Lab 1 and Lab 2)
  
In case of fully remote or hybrid deliveries, we highly recommend to deliver it over 2 half days.

This document is created to help proctors to successfully deliver Fabric RTA-In-A-Day to audience and make the content self-sufficient.  Proctors are encouraged to complete the labs prior to their delivery to have an end-to-end knowledge on topics, challenges, and tasks. Read further to get help on - Setting the stage for audience and their expectations, presentation, lab structure, FAQ, contribution to the content.  

# What are the expectations from Proctor?  

Being an instructor/proctor means that we are fully aware of entire program and can help participants achieve success in completing the challenges, learning RTA fundamentals, working with KQL queries and earning Fabric RTA-In-A-Day badge.  

Instructor are expected to:

- Block calendars to completely dedicate 8 hours‚Äô time to Fabric RTA-In-A-Day.  
- Be able to do presentation on the content.  
- Prior completion of challenges.  
- Keep the sessions interactive by using questionnaires and polls.  
- Unblock any individual or group with task specific guidance.  
- Ensuring maximum tasks and feedback completion rate. Ex: Be sure to mention that participants completing all challenges will be issued a 'Fabric RTA-In-A-Day' completion badge from Credly.

# Hands-on Labs:  
Participants are required to complete 2 labs in the hands-on session to earn digital badge. Each lab is divded into 4 challenges and each challenge has a set of tasks. Some tasks are aimed at introducing the capability while others are requirements that need to be fulfilled to earn the badge. Tasks that require pasting queries in the answer sheets are marked with a ‚Äògraduation hat‚Äô üéìnext to the task header. Answer sheet for each lab is linked at the start of lab on the respective GitHub pages. Participants only need to paste the queries relating to tasks in the respective sections in answer sheets.

The Learning sessions are divided into 2 Labs ‚Äì Lab 1 and Lab 2.
